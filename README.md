## ⚠️ Caution: Beta Version  
This beta app is still in **heavy development and contains bugs**.  
❗Please check [here](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui/blob/main/known_bugs.md) for known bugs especially **MAJOR BUGS** before using the app, so you can use it with full awareness of any known issues.  
If you encounter any issues that are **not yet listed** in the Issues section or into [known bugs](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui/blob/main/known_bugs.md), please **open a new issue** to report them.  

🔐 Although it's a beta version, you can use this app with **minimal risk** to your Audiobookshelf library.  
At worst, you may experience **sync issues**, but there is **no risk** of data loss, deletion, or irreversible changes (API is just used to retrieve books and sync them).

## 📝 Notes
### 🤝 **Contributing**  
Do not hesitate to contribute to this project by submitting your code, ideas, or feedback. Please make sure to read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

### 🍏 **macOS**
>[!WARNING]
>**Not yet supported on macOS (but we are working on it).**

### 🎨 **UI**
The **font** and **emojis** may vary depending on the terminal you are using.
To ensure the best experience, it's recommended to use terminals that support **emoji rendering** properly (e.g., Kitty, Alacritty).

### 🎧 **Using `cvlc`**
- Type `help` to see commands  
- When using **`cvlc`** (command-line VLC), make sure to use the `shutdown` command when you want to quit the listening session.
This helps ensure that your books are successfully synced and prevents any potential issues.
