# Contributing to Toutui

Thanks for your interest in **Toutui**! 🦜

## ⚠️ Beta Version
This project is still in **heavy development**. I built this app to learn Rust. The code isn’t fully optimized or clear. However, feel free to contact me with any questions. There are known bugs (check [known_bugs](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui/blob/main/known_bugs.md) and open issues).

Check the [roadmap](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-roadmap) to see what I'm currently working on.  
If you want to contribute new features but don't have any ideas, feel free to check the [future features](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui?tab=readme-ov-file#-future-features) section for inspiration.   

## 💬 How to Contribute
- **Share your theme**: Check [here](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui-theme).
- **Suggestions/feedback**: Open an issue (feature request) or use [discussions](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui/discussions).
- **Bugs**: Report bugs not listed in issues or [known bugs](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui/blob/main/known_bugs.md). Use the appropriate issue section (Installation issue or bug report).
- **Code**: Fork the repo, create a branch, and submit a pull request. **I encourage you to discuss your ideas with me before a PR** (to ensure no one else is working on it). Code doesn’t need to be perfect—let’s collaborate and improve it together!
